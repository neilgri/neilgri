### :man_technologist: About Me :
In my 20-year professional career in the IT industry, I have worked with Windows, Linux, VMWare, iSeries, PowerShell, Cisco, CheckPoint, Citrix, Exchange, Active Directory, Dell PowerEdge, and multiple other technologies I still need to document here.

I am an influential people leader and mentor and an effective independent worker. Still, I am motivated to collaborate with peers and coworkers to discuss and debate designs to maximize quality and enhance teamwork.

Automation has long played a role in my technical approach, whether with PowerShell scripting in Exchange or Active Directory. My current focus is IaC in cloud builds, and I am experienced in TerraForm for both Azure and AWS. I constantly learn new methods to improve my code, which motivates me.

- Currently, I'm working as a lead Infrastructure Architect utilizing my expertise in Azure, AWS, and technical project management.
- I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through technical blogs, where I write about my experiences, tutorials, and best practices
- You can see my website here [![grinntec](https://img.shields.io/badge/grinntec-blue)](https://www.grinntec.net)
